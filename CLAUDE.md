- Always add imports to the top of the file, not in the middle
- Keep the existing thresholds for coverage requirements, line-lengths, ignore rules etc. unless excplicitly told to change them
- `make lint` is the single source of truth for linting errors, not IDE
- The test suite is fast enough that it can be executed fully always unless fixing some very specific issue
- When leaving comments to code, prefer *why* something is done instead of explaining *what* something does, especially if it's evident fromt the code. If leaving a *what* comment, consider if it should be a small function instead.
